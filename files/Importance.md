I had this silly realisation yesterday while arguing with my friend about giving importance and priority to people. He was obviously advising me to invest my resources on the right people, and I was explaining him how I weigh the importance of resources and how I allocate them to people.

The TLDR of weightage of resources is like this, from most important to least important
1. Emotions
2. Time
3. Money
4. Cognition

This is 100% unique and personal to me and can change based on person to person. And this might change even for me as time passes by but as of now this is the state of things. Let me explain each in details.

**Cognition** is although not cheap but if compared to the other things in this list, it is something that I feel is okay to rank the lowest. Although it is not cheap, but I feel that's the only thing I have in abundance right now and I also waste a lot of it on useless things, so to start with, I feel cognition is the resource that you can spend on people who do not deserve a lot. Like helping someone out, using your "brain power" to solve something. Thinking does not take a lot of efforts, and it is generally wasted a lot. At least I am in a position right now where I feel that that cognition can be given out easily in moderate quantities.

For example, helping strangers, solving colleague's problems, etc. Basically people you do not care about should get this at maximum. But nothing more than this.

**Money** is the next easiest resource which you can spend on someone, and it does not harm you or take away something from you. Of course the opportunity cost is always there, but spending money itself does not take a lot of efforts. It's just a button click away. People value it a lot because of the opportunity cost, which is true, earning money takes cognition and time but we can ignore it for now because I am not talking about spending your whole fortune on someone. 

Money is a strong indicator in a fool's eyes which and can hold very strong importance for them. So spending money can signal strong emotions. Generally money is spent on people who are closest to you. But if we think logically that may not be the case actually. Money does not rank that high in my perspective. It is easily disposable and it is easily recoverable. So I feel it should be spent on people who you want to keep in good faith but are not worth more efforts.

For example, distant relatives, casual friends, dates, business relations.

Next comes **time**, which is the most definite and scarce resource and non recoverable. Which once spent is never coming back and hence should be weighed very cautiously. I do not feel that there is a need to explain why time is important. And it is easily ranked above money and cognition because it cannot regenerate. It is limited. It should be spent on people who you really care about like friends, family, spouses and children.

And the final boss is **EMOTIONS**, slightly underrated but most powerful of all. Emotions, I believe are the most powerful resource of all because it directly affects time and cognition and hence it effects the ability to make money. Emotions are hard to fix if they are ruined and any extremes of them are dangerous. Emotions affect our whole being and hence should not be taken lightly.

I strongly believe now, after having done a lot of mistakes that emotions should be used very sparingly and should be gifted to only the people you love and give the utmost importance to. Emotions should not be handed out to randoms, be it people or ideas and should be gifted (yes gifted not given) to only those who are worthy of it and can value it.

For me that can be the almighty, a partner and members of the family who I love and very genuine and close friends. Apart from this, we shall rethink at least 5 times before spending your emotional quotient on anyone.

This entry ends here, but I feel I will add more to this chain of thought and the order might change and or or I will get more clarity about things and I will add more to this idea later. But for today this is it.
