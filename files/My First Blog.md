Not technically my first blog though but the first one in this new setup. I am giving up on the old one as it was bugging me, I do not want to use Wordpress, I do not want to use ghost, I do not want to use any of these bloated mess while I can write my own blog.

And to write this, my motivation today came from [this blog post](https://pthorpe92.dev/intro/my-story/), What an inspiring story it is wow, I am really surprised of what people rise up from, this guy, the primeagn and everyone who were in a deep hole once and have recovered from there are really inspiring for me, as I am also in a similar situation right now and I am trying to get out of it. 

I am very positive about it happening, I know it very well that I will get it done, it is not a big problem for me. All I need is consistency and focus, which are the exact things that I lack in life : )

So this blog will serve as an continuation of the earlier blog which was buildingyash.com, which will be unavailable as the domain is expiring. The name comes from Panther's username across all social medias, it serves as an archive of the process of building yourself. 

Apart from that, nowadays I am trying to upgrade my lifestyle and my mentality, where I am trying to not worried about minuscule things and waste my time in little things. As siege says "meri dikkate hai khandani, tere choti choth ka yaha koi wanda nahi". I really want to not worry about such small things at all.

Apart from that I started preparing for GATE, but I am not consistent at all, which is not a good thing at all, I am trying to improve and I am sure I will be doing good in no time, I am very hopeful about it. This won't end up like my JEE prepartion atleast.
