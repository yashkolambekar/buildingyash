I have lost the count of the number of times I have made this commitment, number of times I have made this resolution, number of times I have made the attempt to change. I have failed every single time to uplift myself out of the pit that I am in. It is a pattern so robust that I have started giving up even the idea of change.

But I believe that I am built for way better things than these petty problems. I just need to change my focus from the distractions to the actual problems that I have undertake. Now in this, there is also a physical factor that I cannot dismiss. The noise, the heat, the poking and the interruptions that happen to me physically while trying to get something to work. It is the biggest factor that is holding me back as of now.

But then I also think that this is just an excuse to not try and not perform. I believe it is, although the disturbances are there, but I should look at it as a mere inconvenience rather than a hurdle in my life. Because you can get things done with inconveniences existing, and you can get things done only after solving the hurdles, which is then another form of procrastination or excuse that I can give for not doing things

I feel really grateful to have the resources which I have in my head, these resources have enough potential to easily expand my potential. But I think nowadays I am low on bandwith, or rather I will say my bandwith is getting exhausted in passtimes or non-important things. I really want to change this.

There is also a shortage of time, I am not able to do things that I am supposed to do. I think this problem is all about observing the patterns and seeing the stats around where my time is going the most, as I do not feel that I am so busy that I have no time to work or do important tasks.

Health is also something that I have completely ignored in the recent year. I have become a typical software guy that has no life beyond his laptop, I am on my laptop from the time I wake up to the time I sleep, and I do no physical labour at all. This is causing my body to weaken, and especially my eyes. I should fix this as soon as possible.

I also feel that I am biting too many pies at the same time, I have a day job, I am preparing for GATE and I am also building my own startup. Although I am not doing great at any of the three, but I am doing these things. Now the dilemma is whether I should put more force all together so that all three things get more energy or I should eliminate something so that the energy gets used in the two things. But to be very honest, I do not want to give up on any of these three. I really don't want to.
